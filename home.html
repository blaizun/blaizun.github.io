            <p>Hello, my name is Blaizun Diamond. I study computer science and design at the University of Colorado Boulder. If you're seeing this page, I've probably applied
                to work for you or your company. You can find my resume and some examples of my work below. If you would like to contact me, my email is <b>bldi9852@colorado.edu</b>

        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>Most of my art are collages I make in photoshop using magazines I collect from thrift shops. Some of the examples below are fictional movie posters or magazine covers I made for 
            my design class. I also like to work in blender, however I'm still quite new to that medium. I also enjoy creative coding using libraries such as p5.js.
        </p>
